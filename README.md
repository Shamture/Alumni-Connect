# Alumni-Connect
Mini project using MEAN stack.

# Backend used
I have used [MLab](https://mlab.com/) to store my database.

# Running the application
Run the following command in both the sub directories 

> npm install

Next run the following command from the frontend folder to start the angular application.

> ng serve

Now run the following command from the expressapp folder to start the node app and start the backend.

> npm start

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200 

This app is still in beta mode, so you can come across some minor glitches. 

# Provide feedback to the developer
We want your feedback on this beta app. To provide feedback just open an issue and you we will be reverted back shortly.
